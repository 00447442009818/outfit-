Dynamic Fashion Database: Recommendations are sourced from a continuously updated database of fashion styles and trends.
Technology Stack-
Backend: Python
Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
Image Processing: PIL, OpenCV
Data Storage: Pickle for storing image embeddings
Frontend: Streamlit
Algorithm: Nearest Neighbors for similarity search
How It Works
File Upload: Users can upload an image using the file uploader in the app.
Feature Extraction: The uploaded image is processed to extract features using the pre-trained ResNet50 model.
Recommendation: The extracted features are compared with precomputed embeddings to find similar outfits using the Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
Display: The app displays the uploaded image and the recommended outfits side by side.
File Structure
page.py: This file contains the main logic for image upload, feature extraction, and the recommendation engine. It defines functions to process uploaded images, extract features, and recommend similar outfits based on user inputs.
test.py: This file includes test cases for the various functions in page.py. It ensures that the image processing, feature extraction, and recommendation functionalities work as intended. You can run this file to validate your implementation and check for any issues.
main.py: This is the entry point of the application. It initializes and runs the Streamlit app, handling the user interface and managing user interactions.
